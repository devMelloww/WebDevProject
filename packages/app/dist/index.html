            <h1>Profiteroles</h1>
            <h2>(France)</h2>
            <div class="info-container">
              <p>
                Beautiful, sweet and small enough to eat more than is probably
                advisable, profiteroles come in any assortment of flavors.
                Filled with vanilla custard, cream or even ice cream, these
                little cream puffs can be topped with chocolate sauce, fruit or
                just served plain.
              </p>
              <p>
                The airy, delicate pastry is pâte à choux, or choux pastry. One
                of the backbones of French patisserie, choux is the dough used
                for éclairs, beignets, the Paris-Brest and more. It’s made by
                cooking flour with water, milk and butter before mixing in the
                eggs. The resulting dough is wet and pipable and puffs up when
                baked.

            <h1>Arancini</h1>
            <h2>(Italy)</h2>
            <div class="info-container">
              <p>
                Arancini are fried rice balls. There are two main types: Roman
                and Sicilian. Both are filled with ragu or tomato sauce,
                mozzarella cheese, and Arborio rice, used to make risotto. The
                difference is that the Sicillian arancino recipes typically add
                beef and peas. Those are common fillings, but you can also find
                arancini filled with other vegetables.
              </p>
              <p>
                Arancini are coated in breadcrumbs and deep fried giving them a
                golden and crispy outside, which is how they got their name
                “Arancini”, which means little orange. They are served with a
                side of marinara sauce and are one of the best Italian treats
                found in all kinds of establishments around Italy including
                market stalls, pubs and bars, and fine dining restaurants. A
                locals favorite!

            <h2>(Germany)</h2>
            <div class="info-container">
              <p>
                Maultaschen from Swabia, southwestern Germany, are a lot like
                ravioli but bigger. They are typically palm-sized, square
                pockets of dough with fillings that run the gamut from savory to
                sweet and meaty to vegetarian.
              </p>
              <p>
                A traditional combination is minced meat, bread crumbs, onions
                and spinach – all seasoned with salt, pepper and parsley.
                They’re often simmered and served with broth instead of sauce
                for a tender, creamier treat, but are sometimes pan-fried and
                buttered for extra richness.
