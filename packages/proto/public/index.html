            <p>
              Beautiful, sweet and small enough to eat more than is probably
              advisable, profiteroles come in any assortment of flavors. Filled
              with vanilla custard, cream or even ice cream, these little cream
              puffs can be topped with chocolate sauce, fruit or just served
              plain.
            </p>
            <p>
              The airy, delicate pastry is pâte à choux, or choux pastry. One of
              the backbones of French patisserie, choux is the dough used for
              éclairs, beignets, the Paris-Brest and more. It’s made by cooking
              flour with water, milk and butter before mixing in the eggs. The
              resulting dough is wet and pipable and puffs up when baked.

          <div class="info-container">
            <p>
              Arancini are fried rice balls. There are two main types: Roman and
              Sicilian. Both are filled with ragu or tomato sauce, mozzarella
              cheese, and Arborio rice, used to make risotto. The difference is
              that the Sicillian arancino recipes typically add beef and peas.
              Those are common fillings, but you can also find arancini filled
              with other vegetables.
            </p>
            <p>
              Arancini are coated in breadcrumbs and deep fried giving them a
              golden and crispy outside, which is how they got their name
              “Arancini”, which means little orange. They are served with a side
              of marinara sauce and are one of the best Italian treats found in
              all kinds of establishments around Italy including market stalls,
              pubs and bars, and fine dining restaurants. A locals favorite!

          <h1>Maultaschen</h1>
          <h2>(Germany)</h2>
          <div class="info-container">
            <p>
              Maultaschen from Swabia, southwestern Germany, are a lot like
              ravioli but bigger. They are typically palm-sized, square pockets
              of dough with fillings that run the gamut from savory to sweet and
              meaty to vegetarian.
            </p>
            <p>
              A traditional combination is minced meat, bread crumbs, onions and
              spinach – all seasoned with salt, pepper and parsley. They’re
              often simmered and served with broth instead of sauce for a
              tender, creamier treat, but are sometimes pan-fried and buttered
              for extra richness.
