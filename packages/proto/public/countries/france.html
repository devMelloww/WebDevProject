              <p>
                With a long name and an even longer list of ingredients, bouillabaisse is Marseille’s gift to France’s culinary canon. 
                The soup, once a poor man’s dish and now a mainstay on many a Michelin-starred menu, elevates the catch of the day beyond 
                your standard soupe de poisson.
              </p>
              <p>
                According to the Mediterranean port’s bouillabaisse charter, in an attempt to standardize the ingredients and preparation 
                of the classic dish, the soup must include at least four of six specific fish selections that are cut up in front of the diners.

            <h1>Ratatouille</h1>
            <div>
              <p>
                More appetizing than the famous Parisian rat, Ratatouille is a thick stewed vegetable mix made of tomatoes, bell peppers, zucchinis, 
                eggplants, onions, and garlic.
              </p>
              <p>
                This traditional French meal is commonly served as an accompaniment to meats, especially grilled or roasted, but the real fans can also 
                eat it alone, as a vegetable stew. It can also be part of the main course like ratatouille with lamb chops.

              <p>
                Another famous French favourite is quiche Lorraine. A shortcrust pastry tart is filled with an omelette-like mixture consisting of eggs, 
                cream and bacon lardons, to create a delectable savoury meal. Quiche Lorraine is an incredibly versatile French dish that can be served hot 
                or cold, with a range of accompaniments.
              </p>
              <p>
                A traditional quiche Lorraine omits cheese, which seems to have been an ingredient that was added in the twentieth century to lower the price 
                of the dish. Unsurprisingly, the dish originates from the region of Lorraine, in the northeast of France.
