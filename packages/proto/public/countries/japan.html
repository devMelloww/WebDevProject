            <div>
              <p>
                One of the three main noodle varieties eaten in Japan; udon noodles are thick, chewy, and traditionally made from wheat flour and brine water.
              </p>
              <p>
                Udon can be served in a number of different ways (mixed into stir fries, added to hot pots, served cold with a tsuyu or tentsuyu soup base on the 
                side for dipping), but are most commonly used in noodle soups, where they are served in a savoury soup broth with different garnishes.

                If you enjoy crispy fried foods, then you will love tempura. Tempura are pieces or slices of meat, fish, and/or vegetables that have been covered in a 
                special tempura batter and deep fried until they become crunchy and pale gold in colour.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unlike in the UK, where battered foods tend to be made from meats and fish, tempura tends to be made from either small shellfish like prawns, or vegetables 
                like green beans, pumpkin, daikon mooli radish, and sweet potato. Tempura can be eaten by itself (perhaps with a little grated daikon and a small dish of 
                tsuyu for dipping), or served on top of rice bowls or noodle soups.

            <div>
              <p>
                Possibly one of the most controversial dishes in all of Japanese cuisine, sashimi is raw fish or meat that has been expertly cut into thin slices and typically 
                comes served with daikon radish, pickled ginger, wasabi and soy sauce.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sashimi differs from sushi in that all sushi is made with vinegared rice and does not always contain raw fish, while sashimi is almost exclusively raw fish 
                    and is never served with rice. The fish used to make sashimi must be as fresh as possible, both in order to minimise the risk of contamination, and because 
                    fresher fish makes for tastier sashimi.
