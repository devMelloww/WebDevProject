                The perfect example of the beauty of simplicity… the simple combination of eggs, flour, water, olive oil, and salt gives us more than 400 styles 
                of pasta! Some of the most popular types of pasta are fettuccine, spaghetti, penne, and tagliatelle. Each region in Italy has its own signature style: 
                Tuscany houses the best pappardelle and Rome the fettuccine. Pasta may be prepared in a variety of ways: creamy, with pesto, with fresh tomato sauce, 
                or even stuffed. But certainly, one of the most popular pasta dishes in Italy, especially in Rome, is Spaghetti a la Carbonara made with guanciale, egg, 
                pecorino cheese, and black pepper.

            <h1>Arancini</h1>
            <div>
              <p>
                Arancini are fried rice balls. There are two main types: Roman and Sicilian. Both are filled with ragu or tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, and Arborio rice, 
                used to make risotto. The difference is that the Sicillian arancino recipes typically add beef and peas. Those are common fillings, but you can also find arancini 
                filled with other vegetables. Arancini are coated in breadcrumbs and deep fried giving them a golden and crispy outside, which is how they got their name “Arancini”, 
                which means little orange. They are served with a side of marinara sauce and are one of the best Italian treats found in all kinds of establishments around Italy 
                including market stalls, pubs and bars, and fine dining restaurants. A locals favorite!

            <h1>Focaccia</h1>
            <div>
              <p>
                Italian dough is so good that it needed a special bread to homage it. Focaccia is an oven-baked Italian bread in between flatbread and pizza. Depending on the region, 
                it may look different, it may have different ingredients and toppings, and even a different name. In the Tuscan area it is known as schiacciata, in Basilicata, strazzata, 
                and crescia in Umbria. It is typically a bread with herb toppings and olive oil. Perfect for a starter or just as an afternoon snack.
